# ADR-0009: Core Web Vitals Optimization

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Core Web Vitals are essential metrics that Google uses for search rankings and represent real user experience. Poor Core Web Vitals scores directly impact SEO, user engagement, and conversion rates. Alchemorsel v3 must deliver exceptional user experience across all devices and network conditions.

Core Web Vitals metrics:
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** <2.5s for good user experience
- **First Input Delay (FID):** <100ms for good responsiveness  
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** <0.1 for visual stability

Current challenges:
- Heavy JavaScript bundles affecting FID
- Unoptimized images causing poor LCP
- Dynamic content loading causing CLS
- Third-party scripts impacting all metrics

Business impact:
- SEO rankings directly affected by Core Web Vitals
- User engagement drops significantly with poor performance
- Conversion rates decrease with loading delays

## Decision
We will implement comprehensive Core Web Vitals optimization as a primary performance requirement with specific targets and monitoring.

**Performance Targets:**

**Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) < 2.5s:**
- Optimize hero images with WebP/AVIF formats
- Implement responsive images with srcset
- Preload critical resources (fonts, hero images)
- Use CDN for static asset delivery
- Optimize server response times (TTFB <600ms)

**First Input Delay (FID) < 100ms:**
- Code splitting to reduce main thread blocking
- Defer non-critical JavaScript execution
- Optimize event handlers with passive listeners
- Use requestIdleCallback for background tasks
- Minimize third-party script impact

**Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) < 0.1:**
- Define explicit dimensions for all media elements
- Reserve space for dynamic content with skeleton screens
- Avoid inserting content above existing content
- Use CSS aspect-ratio for responsive elements
- Load fonts with font-display: swap

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Lighthouse CI integration with Core Web Vitals budgets
- Real User Monitoring (RUM) for actual user data
- Performance monitoring alerts for threshold violations
- A/B testing for performance optimization impact
- Monthly Core Web Vitals review and optimization cycles

**Monitoring Stack:**
- Google PageSpeed Insights API integration
- Web Vitals JavaScript library for RUM data
- Performance budgets in CI/CD pipeline
- Core Web Vitals dashboard for team visibility
