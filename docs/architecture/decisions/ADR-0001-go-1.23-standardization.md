# ADR-0001: Go 1.23 Standardization

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Alchemorsel v3 project requires a consistent Go runtime environment across all development, testing, and production environments. Go 1.23 introduced significant improvements in performance, security, and developer experience that align with our project requirements.

Key factors considered:
- Performance improvements in Go 1.23 garbage collector
- Enhanced security features for container environments
- Improved toolchain consistency
- Better support for modern development practices
- Long-term support timeline

## Decision
We will standardize on Go 1.23 as the minimum required version for all Alchemorsel v3 components.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- All Dockerfiles must specify `FROM golang:1.23-alpine` as base image
- Local development environments must use Go 1.23+
- CI/CD pipelines must use Go 1.23 for builds and tests
- Go modules must specify `go 1.23` in go.mod files
- All team members must upgrade to Go 1.23 within 2 weeks

## Consequences

### Positive
- Consistent runtime behavior across all environments
- Access to latest performance optimizations
- Enhanced security features for container deployments
- Improved developer tooling and debugging capabilities
- Future-proofed for Go ecosystem evolution

### Negative
- Requires immediate upgrade of all development environments
- Potential compatibility issues with legacy tooling
- Learning curve for new Go 1.23 features

### Neutral
- Standard Docker image sizes remain similar
- Build times expected to improve slightly
- No impact on existing API contracts
