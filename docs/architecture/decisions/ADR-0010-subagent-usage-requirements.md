# ADR-0010: Subagent Usage Requirements

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Alchemorsel v3 integrates AI capabilities through subagent interactions for various tasks including content generation, analysis, and user assistance. These interactions must be reliable, cost-effective, and provide consistent user experiences while managing API costs and response times.

Subagent use cases:
- Content analysis and summarization
- User query processing and responses
- Data extraction and transformation
- Recommendation generation
- Quality assurance and validation

Requirements:
- Consistent response quality across different models
- Cost optimization through intelligent model selection
- Fallback mechanisms for service reliability
- Response caching to reduce API calls
- Rate limiting to prevent cost overruns

## Decision
We will implement a structured subagent usage framework with clear guidelines for when and how to utilize AI services effectively.

**Subagent Usage Patterns:**

**Primary Use Cases (Required Subagent):**
- Content analysis requiring domain expertise
- Complex user queries needing contextual understanding
- Multi-step reasoning tasks
- Creative content generation
- Language translation and localization

**Prohibited Use Cases (No Subagent):**
- Simple data retrieval from databases
- Basic CRUD operations
- Static content serving
- Mathematical calculations that can be computed
- User authentication and authorization

**Implementation Requirements:**

**Model Selection Strategy:**
- GPT-4 for complex reasoning and analysis
- GPT-3.5-turbo for general conversation and simple tasks
- Specialized models for domain-specific tasks (code, images, etc.)
- Fallback chain: Primary model → Secondary model → Error response

**Caching Requirements:**
- Cache identical requests for 1 hour minimum
- Use semantic similarity for near-duplicate requests
- Cache invalidation based on context changes
- Compressed storage for large responses

**Rate Limiting:**
- Maximum 1000 requests per user per hour
- Exponential backoff for API failures
- Priority queuing for different request types
- Cost tracking and alerting thresholds

**Error Handling:**
- Graceful degradation when subagents unavailable
- Clear user messaging for service limitations
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Fallback to cached or default responses

## Consequences

### Positive
- Intelligent AI integration enhancing user experience

- Reliable service with multiple fallback options
- Scalable architecture supporting various AI providers
- Data-driven insights into AI usage patterns

### Negative
- Additional complexity in service orchestration
- API costs require careful monitoring and optimization
- Response times vary based on model and request complexity
- Dependency on external AI service availability

### Neutral
- Industry standard approach to AI service integration
- Flexible architecture supporting new models and providers
- Performance impact managed through caching and optimization
