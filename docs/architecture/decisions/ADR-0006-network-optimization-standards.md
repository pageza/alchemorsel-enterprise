# ADR-0006: Network Optimization Standards (14KB First Packet)

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Web performance is critical for user experience, and the first packet size significantly impacts perceived load times, especially on mobile networks and slow connections. The TCP slow start algorithm means that the first 14KB of data can be transmitted immediately without waiting for acknowledgments.

Research shows:
- 14KB is the effective limit for the first round trip on most networks
- Exceeding this limit adds significant latency due to TCP congestion control
- Mobile users are particularly sensitive to first-packet optimization
- Search engines factor Core Web Vitals into rankings

Current challenges:
- Unoptimized HTML/CSS/JS bundling
- Excessive HTTP headers and cookies
- Uncompressed responses
- Render-blocking resources

## Decision
We will enforce a strict 14KB limit for the first packet of critical page resources to optimize initial page load performance.

**Implementation Requirements:**

**HTML/CSS Optimization:**
- Critical CSS must be inlined and under 14KB total
- Above-the-fold content must render within first packet
- Non-critical CSS loaded asynchronously
- HTML compression (gzip/brotli) enabled

**JavaScript Optimization:**
- Critical JavaScript inlined if under 2KB
- Non-critical JavaScript deferred or loaded asynchronously
- Bundle splitting to prioritize essential functionality
- Tree shaking to eliminate unused code

**Server Configuration:**
- Brotli compression with level 6 for text resources
- HTTP/2 server push for critical resources (deprecated, use preload instead)
- Resource hints (preload, prefetch) for next navigation
- Optimal cache headers to minimize repeat requests

**Monitoring:**
- Performance budgets enforced in CI/CD
- Real User Monitoring (RUM) for actual performance tracking
- Lighthouse CI integration with 14KB budget enforcement
- Alert thresholds for first packet size violations

## Consequences

### Positive
- Significantly improved Time to First Byte (TTFB) and First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Better user experience on slow connections and mobile networks
- Improved Core Web Vitals scores affecting SEO rankings
- Reduced server bandwidth usage
- Higher conversion rates due to faster page loads

### Negative
- Additional complexity in build and deployment pipelines
- Potential limitations on rich initial page content
- Requires ongoing monitoring and optimization efforts
- May require refactoring of existing page structures

### Neutral
- Industry standard best practice alignment
- Compatible with modern web optimization techniques
- Supports progressive enhancement strategies
