# ADR-0013: Security Framework Standards

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Alchemorsel v3 handles sensitive user data, financial information, and AI model interactions that require robust security measures. Security must be built into every layer of the application architecture, from data storage to API endpoints to user authentication.

Security requirements:
- Protection of user personal and financial data
- Secure AI model API key management
- Prevention of common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Compliance with data protection regulations
- Secure container and deployment practices

Threat model considerations:
- Data breaches through SQL injection or similar attacks
- Unauthorized access to user accounts
- API key theft and misuse
- Man-in-the-middle attacks
- Container escape and privilege escalation

## Decision
We will implement a comprehensive security framework based on defense-in-depth principles with specific standards for each layer of the application.

**Security Framework Layers:**

**Application Security:**
- Input validation and sanitization for all user inputs
- Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- CSRF protection with secure tokens
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Secure session management with HttpOnly cookies

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- bcrypt password hashing with minimum cost factor 12
- Multi-factor authentication support
- JWT tokens with secure signing and expiration
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints

**Data Protection:**
- Encryption at rest using AES-256 for sensitive data
- TLS 1.3 for all data in transit
- Database connection encryption
- Secure key management with rotation procedures
- Data classification and handling procedures

**Infrastructure Security:**
- Container security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Non-root container execution
- Network segmentation with Docker networks
- Regular security updates and patching
- Secure secrets management (no secrets in code/containers)

**API Security:**
- API rate limiting per user and endpoint
- Request size limits to prevent DoS attacks
- API key rotation and monitoring
- Input validation middleware
- Comprehensive logging for security events

**Implementation Requirements:**

**Security Headers (All HTTP Responses):**
```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

**Container Security:**
- Multi-stage builds with minimal final images
- Regular vulnerability scanning with tools like Trivy
- Non-privileged user execution (USER 1000:1000)
- Read-only root filesystem where possible
- Resource limits to prevent resource exhaustion

**Monitoring and Incident Response:**
- Security event logging and monitoring
- Automated alerting for suspicious activities
- Incident response procedures and contact information
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing
- Security metrics and reporting dashboard

## Consequences

### Positive
- Comprehensive protection against common vulnerabilities
- Compliance with security best practices and regulations
- Early detection of security threats through monitoring
- Reduced risk of data breaches and financial losses
- Improved user trust and reputation

### Negative
- Additional development overhead for security implementations
- Performance impact from security measures (encryption, validation)
- Complexity in key management and rotation procedures
- Regular security updates and maintenance required

### Neutral
- Industry standard security practices
- Compatible with compliance frameworks (SOC 2, GDPR)
- Foundation for future security certifications
