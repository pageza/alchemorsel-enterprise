# ADR-0008: Database Performance Standards

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Database performance directly impacts user experience and system scalability. Alchemorsel v3 must handle complex queries efficiently while maintaining data consistency and supporting concurrent users. Poor database performance can cascade through the entire application stack.

Performance challenges identified:
- Complex analytical queries for user insights
- High-frequency read operations for API responses
- Batch processing for AI model training data
- Real-time updates for user interactions
- Concurrent user sessions requiring ACID compliance

Performance targets:
- 95th percentile query response time under 100ms
- Support for 1000+ concurrent connections
- Sub-second response for complex analytical queries
- 99.9% uptime for production databases

## Decision
We will implement comprehensive database performance standards with specific metrics, monitoring, and optimization strategies.

**Performance Standards:**

**Query Performance Targets:**
- Simple SELECT queries: <10ms (95th percentile)
- Complex JOIN queries: <50ms (95th percentile)
- Analytical queries: <1s (95th percentile)
- INSERT/UPDATE operations: <25ms (95th percentile)
- Batch operations: <5s for 1000 records

**Indexing Requirements:**
- All foreign keys must have indexes
- Composite indexes for multi-column WHERE clauses
- Partial indexes for filtered queries
- Regular ANALYZE and VACUUM operations
- Index usage monitoring and optimization

**Connection Management:**
- Connection pooling with pgbouncer or built-in pooling
- Maximum 100 connections per application instance
- Connection timeout: 30 seconds
- Idle connection cleanup: 5 minutes

**Query Optimization:**
- All queries must use EXPLAIN ANALYZE for optimization
- N+1 query detection and prevention
- Query plan caching enabled
- Slow query logging for queries >100ms

**Monitoring Implementation:**
- PostgreSQL `pg_stat_statements` extension enabled
- Real-time query performance dashboards
- Automated alerts for performance degradation
- Weekly performance review and optimization cycles

## Consequences

### Positive
- Predictable and fast database performance
- Proactive identification of performance regressions
- Scalable architecture supporting growth
- Optimized resource utilization and cost control
- Data-driven optimization decisions

### Negative
- Additional monitoring and maintenance overhead
- Requires PostgreSQL expertise for advanced optimization
- Performance testing must be part of development workflow
- Index maintenance adds complexity to schema changes

### Neutral
- Industry standard PostgreSQL optimization practices
- Compatible with managed database services
- Performance improvements benefit all application features
