## Incident Response Process

### Phase 1: Detection and Initial Response (0-15 minutes)

#### 1.1 Incident Detection
Incidents can be detected through:
- Automated monitoring alerts (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Customer reports (support tickets, social media)
- Internal team observations
- Third-party service notifications

#### 1.2 Initial Assessment
```bash
# Quick health check commands
kubectl get pods -n alchemorsel
curl -I https://api.alchemorsel.com/health
./scripts/quick-health-check.sh
```

#### 1.3 Incident Declaration
1. Create incident in incident management system
2. Assess initial severity based on impact
3. Page appropriate response team members
4. Create dedicated Slack channel: `#incident-YYYY-MM-DD-001`

### Phase 2: Investigation and Diagnosis (15-45 minutes)

#### 2.1 War Room Setup
1. Join incident Slack channel
2. Start video conference call
3. Share screen for collaborative debugging
4. Begin incident timeline documentation

#### 2.2 Information Gathering
```bash
# System status checks
kubectl describe pods -n alchemorsel
kubectl logs -f deployment/alchemorsel-api -n alchemorsel

# Database checks
./scripts/db-health-check.sh

# Application metrics
curl -s http://prometheus:9090/api/v1/query?query=up
curl -s http://prometheus:9090/api/v1/query?query=rate(http_requests_total[5m])

# Infrastructure status
terraform plan -refresh=true
aws elbv2 describe-target-health --target-group-arn $TARGET_GROUP_ARN
```

#### 2.3 Impact Assessment
- Determine affected user percentage
- Identify affected services and features
- Estimate business impact (revenue, reputation)
- Update severity classification if needed

### Phase 3: Resolution (Ongoing)

#### 3.1 Hypothesis Formation
1. Review recent changes (deployments, configuration)
2. Analyze logs and metrics for anomalies
3. Check dependencies and third-party services
4. Form initial hypothesis for root cause

#### 3.2 Resolution Attempts
```bash
# Common resolution commands
kubectl rollout undo deployment/alchemorsel-api -n alchemorsel
kubectl scale deployment/alchemorsel-api --replicas=5 -n alchemorsel
./scripts/restart-services.sh
./scripts/clear-cache.sh
```

#### 3.3 Testing and Validation
- Validate resolution with monitoring tools
- Perform functional testing
- Monitor for secondary effects
- Confirm customer impact resolution

### Phase 4: Communication

#### 4.1 Internal Communication
- Regular updates in incident channel (every 15-30 minutes)
- Stakeholder notifications per escalation matrix
- Executive briefings for Severity 1/2 incidents

#### 4.2 External Communication
- Status page updates
- Customer email notifications (if required)
- Social media updates (if applicable)
- Support team briefings

#### 4.3 Communication Templates

## Escalation Procedures

### Automatic Escalation Triggers
- No acknowledgment within response time SLA
- Incident duration exceeds resolution target
- Severity escalation due to impact growth
- Multiple failed resolution attempts

### Escalation Matrix
