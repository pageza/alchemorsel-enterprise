# PRD-001: Docker Deployment System

**Version**: 1.0  
**Created**: 2025-08-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Owner**: Platform Team  

## Executive Summary

Establish a robust containerized deployment system for Alchemorsel v3 that enables consistent, zero-downtime deployments across all environments while maintaining service isolation and security best practices.

## Objective

Create a production-ready Docker Compose architecture that separates API and web services, implements proper health checks, manages secrets securely, and enables individual service updates without downtime.

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Current | Priority |
|--------|--------|---------|----------|
| `docker compose up` success rate | 100% | ~60% | P0 |
| Service startup time | <30 seconds | Variable | P1 |
| Zero-downtime deployment capability | 100% | 0% | P0 |
| Container health check reliability | 99.9% | N/A | P1 |
| Secret management security score | A+ | N/A | P0 |

## Requirements

### P0 Requirements (Must Have)

#### R1.2: Health Check Implementation
- **Description**: Comprehensive health monitoring for all services
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Health check endpoints for API, web, and database services
  - Docker Compose health check integration
  - Service dependency management with proper startup ordering
  - Graceful failure handling and recovery
- **Technical Reference**: ADR-0003

#### R1.3: Secrets Management
- **Description**: Secure handling of sensitive configuration data
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Docker secrets for database credentials
  - Environment-specific secret loading
  - No secrets in container images or logs
  - Rotation capability for all secrets
- **Technical Reference**: ADR-0017 (Secrets Management)

### P1 Requirements (Should Have)

#### R1.4: Container Registry Integration
- **Description**: Automated image building and deployment via ghcr.io
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Automated image building on code changes
  - Version tagging strategy implementation
  - Multi-architecture support (arm64/amd64)
  - Image vulnerability scanning
- **Technical Reference**: ADR-0004 (ghcr.io Registry)

#### R1.5: Development Hot Reload
- **Description**: Fast development iteration with hot reload capabilities
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Go application hot reload <2 seconds
  - Static asset reloading without container restart
  - Database schema migration support
  - Development/production environment parity
- **Technical Reference**: ADR-0018 (Hot Reload Development)

### P2 Requirements (Nice to Have)

#### R1.6: Monitoring Integration
- **Description**: Container and service monitoring capabilities
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Resource usage monitoring
  - Log aggregation and rotation
  - Performance metrics collection
  - Alert configuration for service failures

## User Stories

### US1: Developer Onboarding
**As a** new developer  
**I want** to run `docker compose up` and have a fully functional local environment  
**So that** I can start contributing to the project immediately  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Single command setup from clean repository clone
- All services start successfully within 30 seconds
- Health checks pass for all services
- Sample data is available for development

### US2: Production Deployment
**As a** DevOps engineer  
**I want** to deploy new versions without service interruption  
**So that** users experience zero downtime during updates  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Rolling deployment capability
- Health check validation before traffic routing
- Automatic rollback on deployment failure
- Service state persistence during updates

### US3: Service Maintenance
**As a** platform engineer  
**I want** to update individual services independently  
**So that** I can deploy fixes and features without affecting the entire system  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Independent service versioning
- Service isolation prevents cascade failures
- Configuration updates without full restart
- Dependency management between services

## Technical Requirements

### Infrastructure
- **Container Runtime**: Docker 24.0+, Docker Compose 2.20+
- **Network**: Internal Docker networks with service discovery
- **Storage**: Named volumes for persistent data
- **Registry**: ghcr.io with authentication

### Performance
- **Startup Time**: All services ready within 30 seconds
- **Resource Usage**: <2GB RAM total for development environment
- **Build Time**: Image builds complete within 5 minutes

### Security
- **Secrets**: Docker secrets for sensitive data
- **Network**: No unnecessary port exposure
- **Images**: Regular security updates and vulnerability scanning

## Dependencies

### Blockers
- Go module resolution issues (impacts container builds)
- PostgreSQL migration errors (affects database service startup)
- Container path resolution problems

### External Dependencies
- Docker/Docker Compose installation
- ghcr.io registry access
- PostgreSQL container image
- Redis container image (for caching layer)

## Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Deliverables |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Phase 1: Core Architecture | 1 week | Service separation, basic health checks |
| Phase 2: Security & Secrets | 3 days | Secrets management, security hardening |
| Phase 3: Registry Integration | 3 days | ghcr.io setup, automated builds |
| Phase 4: Developer Experience | 1 week | Hot reload, documentation |

**Total Estimated Duration**: 2.5 weeks

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Go module resolution | High | Medium | Document workarounds, consider go.work files |
| Database migration failures | High | Medium | Implement migration rollback, validation |
| Container networking issues | Medium | Low | Comprehensive testing, fallback configurations |
| Secret management complexity | Medium | Medium | Start with simple approach, iterate |
